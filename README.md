# Team-E: "Our Progress" production tracker app for the Blind Institutes of Maryland
# Background:
The Blind Industries and Services of Maryland is a facility that hires mostly vision impaired, deaf
people, and non-native English speakers. The app outputs production information to the user in real
time, and in an accessible way that accommodates differently abled users.
Team supervisors are able to manage their teams and team members. Additionally, all users are able 
to send and respond to help requests, in an effort to foster a more collaborative and supportive 
environment.
We use a Realtime Firebase database for our app, which keeps tracks of users, teams, and requests.
